# Work-Experience
<h2>EROAD</h2>
I spent 3 months at EROAD as the AppSec Engineer Intern where I :

* Created a dockerfile
* Contributed to the dark-web script where I was partnered with another intern. The script essentially monitors the dark-web for any data leaks
  * The functionalities I mostly worked on was screenshotting of the site, uploading files to the S3 bucket, audit logs
  * Refer to : https://github.com/mk3846dip/Work-Experience/blob/main/example-script.py bear in mind that this is not the original script but rather what I learnt from doing the project
* Learnt more about linux commands
* Completed the "Networking Fundamentals" Cybrary course
* AWS
  * S3 bucket
  * Lambda
  * EC2
  * EKS
* Participated in threat modelling activities
